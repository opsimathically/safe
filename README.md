# Safe

This is a fork of [safe-wrapper](https://github.com/mcking-07/safe-wrapper), which is a project designed to improve error handling try/catch syntax in typescript. I forked the project to potentially add additional features I may need in the future.

## Install

```bash
npm install @opsimathically/safe
```

## Building from source

This package is intended to be run via npm, but if you'd like to build from source,
clone this repo, enter directory, and run `npm install` for dev dependencies, then run
`npm run build`.

## Usage

[See API Reference for documentation](https://github.com/opsimathically/safe/tree/main/docs/)
